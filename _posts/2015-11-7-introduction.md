Yesterday at work I was thinking how cool it would be to have my own blog. To be honest this thought has crossed my mind more than once and I even started on some of them to get caught up in the process of building a backend system. So this time I decided to turn the process around and start by writing a first post instead of a system to write a post in. As this leaves me without a blog but with the content required to fill a blog the subject of this blog was easy to pick, I’m going to write a blog about building a blog.

At this point I think a little introduction might be in order. Hi!! my name is Arjen and I’m living in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. In my daytime job I’m a full stack web developer with affinity for frontend development. the Company I work at (Connect Holland) uses a stack of PHP with MySQL and MongoDB and XSLT as a templating language. Most of the styling is done in SCSS and we are currently working with a frontend build-chain that I build using GulpJS.

A few weeks back I went to Fronteers Conference in Amsterdam and was blown away by the possibilities of static site generators. I always thought of static sites as something the name already suggests a static thing. I could see myself updating multiple pages because a small thing changed. So in the past I used PHP to stick together websites so things like the navigation would be a central snippet instead of on each page separately. Although a great solution the temptation to start moving things into a database was to big, only to find yourself a few years later maintaining mountains of server software and worrying about sql-injections. I’m not saying that static sites are the holy grail to website building because they are not. With the appearance of static site generators and the systems to easily deploy them we might be looking at a new way of delivering websites.

Now back to my (future) blog. With the mention of static site generators I found that there are many players on the market offering different toolsets with the goal creating static sites. Many use different languages to template in like Jade or Ejs and also require different environments to develop in like Ruby or NodeJS. My goal with this blog is to explain how I build this blog but also the choices that I made and why.

Like any website a blog also needs a design and although I’m not a designer my next post will be about the design of the page of the blog, and the choices I had to consider while making those designs. Don’t worry I’ll let a real designer review them :P 

For now I’m done writing this introductory blog post and will upload it now to my github account so I can actually share it with you.

Greetings Arjen.
